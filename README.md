## Multi-App Infrastructure Repository

This repository is a collection of containerized applications and their configurations. Each application is self-contained in its own directory and follows a modular and scalable structure.

## Applications

Each application resides in its own directory and contains:
- Dockerfile(s)
- Configuration files
- Supporting assets
- Its own `README.md` with app-specific documentation
